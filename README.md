=========

Duplicate File Finder (in python 3)

Usage: df-finder [-e <regexp pattern>] [path...]

default path is the current directory
options:
  -e    regexp pattern for directories and files to exclude from search
  -h    print this message
  -v    be verbose
  -vv   be even more verbose
  -0    include empty files (why anyone want to do that?)
